                <p>From the middle of the 19th century, the transformation of the city of Paris by the great renovation under Haussmann
                led to the creation of hollow teeth. These small unexploited plots surrounded by gable walls mark a break in
                the continuity of the bati. To stop the densification of the city of Paris, new constructions will appear to meet the
                constant need for housing. 
                </p>
                
                <p> The project we have dealt with this semester is located at 6-8 rue Bardinet in the 14th arrondissement
                of Paris. The building is in a small plot very constrained by the opposite but
                Through the configuration of this portion of territory,
                the objective was to design living spaces offering direct
                openings to the two most interesting points of view of
                the project: the green garden and the square located at
                the intersection of the street.
                The volumetry of the project resulted from an extraction
                of the shaded part on the plot to develop the areas
                exposed to sunlight.
                The project evolves around these two directions that
                orient the openings on the site, allowing to limit the
                opposite while having an optimal brightness through
                an east-west exposure.
                this community consists of seven floors, each serving
                three apartments. The vertical circulation appears as the
                central point of spatial organization with a distribution
                of dwellings around a common landing. The ground
                floor is designed to think collective through a cafe and
                kitchen shared by the residents of the building.
                The exterior marks an access of this small private courtyard
                to the large garden shared with the other plots.
